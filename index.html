    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Starting straight from our kitchen</p>
</div>
<p> Our story begins right in our own home. My son Erik and my wife Beth were baking cooking in our kitchen. Erik had created a numbers of animals, but he handed me a fish cookie. "Look daddy, he said, "it's the perfect salmon cookie. It's the most delicious cookie in the world." </p>
<h3>And to believe it all started out with this one cookie...</h3>
